# Unhandled Exceptions in Arithmetic Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: the failure to handle unexpected inputs or invalid operations. Specifically, the original code lacks robust error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.

The `bug.js` file contains the initial code with this flaw, resulting in unhandled exceptions.  The improved version in `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by implementing comprehensive error handling and input validation.

## How to run the code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (browser console, Node.js, etc.).
3. Execute the code to observe the behavior of both the faulty and improved versions.

## Learning Outcomes

By examining this code and its solution, you'll gain a better understanding of:

* The importance of comprehensive error handling in JavaScript.
* The use of `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions.
* Input validation to prevent unexpected behavior.
